# STRATEGY_TEMPLATE: Standard Strategy Writing Format

This file defines how a strategy must be written before coding or backtesting.

The goal is to convert a user idea into a strict, reusable, machine-friendly structure.

Use this file before implementation whenever a strategy is vague, incomplete, inconsistent, or written in plain language.

This file describes the strategy logic.
It does not define the Python coding style.
Python implementation style is defined in `STRATEGY_CODE_TEMPLATE.md`.

---

# Core Rule

Do not code a strategy directly from a vague idea.

First convert it into the structured format in this file.

Then pass the structured result into `STRATEGY_CODE_TEMPLATE.md`.

# Strategy Writing Standard

Every strategy must be written using the following structure.

## Strategy Header

- Strategy Name:
- Strategy Type:
- Market Type: OHLC / Index / Multi-sheet OHLC
- Underlying:
- Symbol Universe:
- Target Sheet or Timeframe:
- Timeframe: Daily / Weekly / Monthly
- Trade Style: Positional / Swing / Timeframe-based
- Objective: Mean Reversion / Breakout / Trend / Reversal / Other

## Data Selection

- Source Workbook:
- Target Sheets:
- Required Columns:
- Ticker Filter:
- Date Column Rule:
- Price Columns Rule:

## Entry Rules

- Entry Side: Long / Short / Both
- Entry Trigger:
- Entry Time Rule:
- Signal Lookback:
- Confirmation Filters:
- Re-entry Allowed:
- Re-entry Conditions:

## Exit Rules

- Stop Loss Rule:
- Target Rule:
- Time Exit Rule:
- Signal Exit Rule:
- Forced Exit Rule:
- End-of-Series Exit Rule:

## Position Sizing

- Capital Base:
- Risk Per Trade:
- Units Per Trade:
- Position Sizing Formula:
- Max Concurrent Positions:

## Costs and Execution Assumptions

- Brokerage:
- Slippage:
- Fees and Charges:
- Fill Price Rule:
- Missing Price Handling:
- Holiday Handling:

## Backtest Range

- Start Date:
- End Date:
- In-Sample / Out-of-Sample Rule:
- Excluded Dates:
- Sheet Inclusion Rule:

## Reporting Expectations

- Need Trade Log: Yes / No
- Need Excel Output: Yes / No
- Need Charts: Yes / No
- Need Monthly Stats: Yes / No
- Need Yearly Stats: Yes / No
- Need Parameter Comparison: Yes / No

# Required Strategy Normalization Process

When the user gives an unstructured idea, convert it using these steps:

1. identify market and sheet/timeframe
2. identify ticker selection logic
3. identify entry logic
4. identify exit logic
5. identify sizing logic
6. identify cost assumptions
7. identify backtest date range
8. identify missing items
9. mark missing items as assumptions or blockers
10. pass the structured result into `STRATEGY_CODE_TEMPLATE.md`

---

# Missing Rule Policy

If a critical rule is missing, do one of these:

- mark it as an explicit assumption if a reasonable reversible assumption exists
- mark it as blocked if coding would become misleading without it

Critical missing items usually include:

- entry trigger
- exit logic
- target sheet or timeframe
- ticker selection
- sizing logic

# Strategy Snippet Library

Use these snippets to help standardize strategy writing.

## Snippet: Daily Sheet Selection
- Target Sheets: Use daily OHLC sheet for the selected underlying

## Snippet: Weekly Sheet Selection
- Target Sheets: Use weekly OHLC sheet for the selected underlying

## Snippet: Monthly Sheet Selection
- Target Sheets: Use monthly OHLC sheet for the selected underlying

## Snippet: One Trade Per Signal
- Re-entry Allowed: No
- Re-entry Conditions: Not applicable

## Snippet: Fixed Percent Stop
- Stop Loss Rule: Exit when loss reaches a fixed percent from entry price

## Snippet: Fixed Percent Target
- Target Rule: Exit when gain reaches a fixed percent from entry price

## Snippet: N-Candle Exit
- Time Exit Rule: Exit after N candles from entry if no prior exit condition occurs

## Snippet: Opposite Signal Exit
- Signal Exit Rule: Exit when opposite entry condition becomes true

# Final Rule

A strategy is ready for coding only when it is written in this structure or an equivalent fully explicit structure.

After that, the implementation must follow `STRATEGY_CODE_TEMPLATE.md`.
