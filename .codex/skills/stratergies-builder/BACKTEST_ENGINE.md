# BACKTEST_ENGINE: Workbook Inspection, Backtest Execution, Validation, and Reporting

This file defines how the agent must implement and run the strategy after the rules are structured.

Use this after:

1. strategy logic has been normalized through `STRATEGY_TEMPLATE.md`, and
2. code shape has been defined through `STRATEGY_CODE_TEMPLATE.md` when relevant.

The strategy definition and the coding pattern must both be respected.

---

# Objective

Take a structured strategy and produce:

- code implementation
- backtest execution
- trade log
- performance metrics
- equity curve
- drawdown curve
- Excel workbook
- charts
- validation notes

All outputs must be reproducible from the uploaded workbook.

---

# Required Data Source

The main data source is a local Excel workbook containing OHLC data across one or more sheets.

Typical core columns include:

- `Ticker`
- `Date/Time`
- `Open`
- `High`
- `Low`
- `Close`

Some sheets may contain additional derived columns.
Use only the columns required by the strategy and actually present in the selected sheet.

---

# Mandatory Workbook Inspection Process

Before coding or running, perform these steps:

1. inspect workbook sheet names
2. identify candidate sheets for the strategy timeframe
3. inspect the selected sheet
4. identify column names
5. confirm the date column
6. confirm ticker values
7. confirm OHLC columns
8. identify extra derived columns if relevant
9. identify missing-data patterns
10. identify duplicate-record risk
11. normalize `Date/Time` to `Date` if needed
12. inspect whether an existing local coding pattern already exists

Record findings in implementation notes.

---

# Sheet Selection Rules

The agent must map strategy timeframe and underlying to the appropriate sheet.

Typical examples:

- Nifty daily strategy → `Nifty_D`
- BankNifty daily strategy → `BNF_D`
- Midcap daily strategy → `Mid_D`
- Nifty weekly strategy → `Nifty_W`
- BankNifty weekly strategy → `BNF_W`
- Midcap weekly strategy → `Mid_W`
- Nifty monthly strategy → `Nifty_M`
- BankNifty monthly strategy → `BNF_M`
- Midcap monthly strategy → `Mid_M`

If multiple similar sheets exist, inspect and choose the correct one explicitly.

---

# Data Mapping Rules

The implementation must correctly map:

- ticker field
- date field
- open
- high
- low
- close

Use real sheet columns only.

If a required column is missing, mark the strategy as blocked or adapt only if the adaptation is explicit and safe.

---

# Code Execution Rules

If the task requires adding or updating Python strategy code:

- use `STRATEGY_CODE_TEMPLATE.md` as the implementation style reference
- preserve local naming and loop structure where appropriate
- avoid mixing inconsistent coding patterns
- keep strategy logic and backtest execution auditable
- produce outputs in a repeatable folder structure

---

# Core Backtest Procedure

Run the strategy in this order:

1. load relevant sheet data
2. normalize columns
3. filter by backtest date range
4. filter by ticker if required
5. evaluate entry conditions chronologically
6. create trade entries
7. track open positions
8. evaluate exits chronologically
9. close positions
10. calculate trade-level PnL or return
11. aggregate equity
12. calculate drawdown
13. calculate summary metrics
14. export outputs
15. run validation checks

---

# Trade Log Standard

Each trade log row should contain these fields when available:

- Trade ID
- Entry Date
- Exit Date
- Symbol or Ticker
- Side
- Entry Price
- Exit Price
- Gross PnL
- Net PnL
- Return Percent
- Exit Reason
- Holding Period

If some fields are unavailable, use only fields supported by actual data and implementation.

---

# Performance Metric Standard

Compute these metrics whenever possible:

- Total Trades
- Winning Trades
- Losing Trades
- Win Rate
- Average Win
- Average Loss
- Payoff Ratio
- Profit Factor
- Expectancy
- Total Net PnL
- CAGR or CAR
- Max Drawdown
- CAR/MDD
- Longest Winning Streak
- Longest Losing Streak

If CAR cannot be correctly computed from available capital assumptions, state the limitation clearly.

---

# Equity and Drawdown Rules

The engine must generate:

- equity series
- running peak equity
- drawdown amount
- drawdown percent

Drawdown must be computed from running equity peak, not from arbitrary trade-level comparisons.

---

# Excel Workbook Standard

Create an Excel workbook with these sheets where applicable:

- `Summary`
- `Trades`
- `EquityCurve`
- `Drawdown`
- `MonthlyStats`
- `YearlyStats`
- `Parameters` if optimization is run
- `Validation` if checks are explicitly logged

---

# Summary Sheet Standard

The `Summary` sheet should include:

- strategy name
- date range
- sheet used
- ticker used
- total trades
- win rate
- average win
- average loss
- profit factor
- max drawdown
- CAR
- CAR/MDD
- net PnL
- assumptions summary

---

# Required Charts

Generate these charts when possible:

- equity curve
- drawdown curve
- monthly returns
- yearly returns if applicable
- PnL distribution or trade distribution

Charts may be embedded in Excel or exported separately.

---

# Validation Checklist

Before reporting results, validate:

- workbook loaded correctly
- correct sheet selected
- backtest date range applied correctly
- ticker filter is correct
- no impossible trades
- no duplicate trade rows
- entry and exit timestamps are logical
- PnL arithmetic is correct
- equity curve is continuous
- drawdown calculation is correct
- summary metrics reconcile with trade log
- code structure follows the local standard when relevant

If validation fails, fix the issue before final reporting.

---

# Missing Data and Edge Case Rules

Handle these explicitly:

- missing dates
- duplicate dates
- missing OHLC rows
- ticker mismatch
- empty filtered range
- exit condition never triggered
- overlapping positions
- sheet mismatch

The agent must state how each relevant edge case is handled.

---

# Optimization Rules

If optimization is requested:

1. define baseline strategy first
2. define allowed tunable parameters
3. define parameter ranges explicitly
4. run comparable backtests
5. report parameter-wise results clearly
6. avoid overstating best result as robust
7. distinguish exploratory optimization from validated performance

Optimization outputs should include:

- parameter combinations
- trade count by combination
- CAR
- MDD
- CAR/MDD
- net PnL
- win rate

---

# Implementation Notes Standard

The final implementation notes should mention:

- workbook sheet used
- discovered schema
- date normalization method
- pricing fields used
- ticker filter used
- fill assumptions
- cost assumptions
- skipped cases
- known limitations
- whether the implementation followed an existing local strategy pattern

---

# Final Response Standard

Return these sections:

## Strategy Assumptions
List all explicit assumptions.

## Data Notes
Summarize actual discovered workbook structure and data constraints.

## Code Notes
Summarize how the code was structured and where it was added or updated.

## Implementation Notes
Summarize how the strategy was coded and executed.

## Results
Report main metrics.

## Validation Notes
Report checks performed and issues found or fixed.

## Output Files
List generated files and locations.

## Next Improvements
Suggest realistic refinements only.

---

# Minimal Backtest Function Contract

Use or adapt an interface like this:

`backtest(strategy_spec, start_date, end_date, capital, brokerage, slippage)`

Where:

- `strategy_spec` is the structured result from `STRATEGY_TEMPLATE.md`
- implementation style should follow `STRATEGY_CODE_TEMPLATE.md`
- `start_date` and `end_date` define test range
- `capital` defines capital base
- `brokerage` defines transaction cost assumption
- `slippage` defines fill penalty assumption

The exact code structure may vary, but the implementation must remain auditable.

---

# Final Rule

Do not report polished results from an unvalidated backtest.

The engine is complete only when:
- logic is implemented,
- code structure is appropriate,
- results are generated,
- validations are run,
- outputs are saved,
- limitations are clearly stated.
