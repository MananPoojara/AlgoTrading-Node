# SKILL: Local OHLC Strategy Research, Coding, and Backtesting

This skill helps an AI agent turn a user's trading idea into:

1. a structured strategy definition,
2. executable strategy code,
3. a validated backtest,
4. auditable outputs such as CSV, Excel, metrics, and charts.

This skill is designed for a local Excel workbook that contains OHLC data across multiple sheets.

The agent must always work from the real uploaded Excel workbook and never fabricate schema, fields, trades, or results.

---

# Primary Goal

Use this skill when the user wants to:

- write a new strategy on OHLC data
- convert a trading idea into structured rules
- convert structured rules into Python strategy code
- backtest a strategy on the uploaded Excel workbook
- improve or debug an existing strategy
- generate trade logs, metrics, Excel outputs, or charts
- evaluate CAR, MDD, CAR/MDD, and related performance statistics
- compare multiple strategy variants
- optimize parameter-based strategy rules in a controlled way

# Files In This Skill System

This skill system has 4 parts:

1. `SKILL.md`
   - root guide
   - decides workflow
   - decides when to use the other files

2. `STRATEGY_TEMPLATE.md`
   - converts strategy idea into a strict structured definition
   - standardizes how strategies must be written
   - contains snippets and strategy-writing templates

3. `STRATEGY_CODE_TEMPLATE.md`
   - defines how strategy code should be written
   - matches the local research coding style
   - standardizes function structure, ticker loops, entry/exit processing, and CSV output format

4. `BACKTEST_ENGINE.md`
   - defines how to inspect the Excel workbook
   - defines how to execute the strategy backtest
   - defines validations
   - defines required outputs and Excel workbook structure

---

# Root Workflow

Follow this order:

1. Read the user's request.
2. Determine whether the request is:
   - strategy creation,
   - strategy refinement,
   - strategy coding,
   - backtesting,
   - debugging,
   - result reporting,
   - optimization.
3. If the strategy is not already structured, use `STRATEGY_TEMPLATE.md`.
4. Once the strategy is structured, use `STRATEGY_CODE_TEMPLATE.md` to generate or normalize the Python implementation style.
5. Then use `BACKTEST_ENGINE.md` to inspect the Excel workbook, run the backtest, validate results, and generate outputs.
6. Return assumptions, implementation notes, key metrics, and output file paths.

# Main Data Source

The main source is a local Excel workbook containing OHLC data.

Typical workbook structure includes multiple sheets such as:

- `Nifty_D`
- `BNF_D`
- `Mid_D`
- `Nifty_W`
- `BNF_W`
- `Mid_W`
- `Nifty_M`
- `BNF_M`
- `Mid_M`
- `Mid_Select_D`

Typical core columns include:

- `Ticker`
- `Date/Time`
- `Open`
- `High`
- `Low`
- `Close`

Some sheets may contain extra derived columns.
The agent must inspect the workbook first and use actual available columns only.

---

# When To Use `STRATEGY_TEMPLATE.md`

Use `STRATEGY_TEMPLATE.md` when:

- the user gives a strategy idea in plain language
- entry rules are incomplete
- exit rules are incomplete
- timeframe selection is vague
- position sizing is missing
- transaction cost assumptions are missing
- the strategy needs to be normalized before coding
- multiple strategy variants need to be described in one consistent format

Examples:

- "Buy after 3 red candles"
- "Backtest weekly breakout"
- "Make a strategy with good CAR/MDD"
- "Test RSI strategy on Nifty daily sheet"

If the strategy is ambiguous, convert it into the required structured template before coding.

---

# When To Use `STRATEGY_CODE_TEMPLATE.md`

Use `STRATEGY_CODE_TEMPLATE.md` when:

- the strategy structure is ready
- Python code must be written
- Python code must match the existing research style
- a new strategy function must be added
- an existing strategy function must be refactored into the standard pattern
- multiple strategy variants must be implemented consistently
- strategy code must produce standardized trade logs and CSV outputs

This file is especially important when the local codebase already follows a repeated pattern for:

- function-per-strategy design
- per-ticker loops
- filtered dataframe workflow
- entry-date detection
- forward exit scan
- trade list creation
- CSV export

---

# When To Use `BACKTEST_ENGINE.md`

Use `BACKTEST_ENGINE.md` when:

- strategy rules are already structured
- implementation style is already defined or generated
- the Excel workbook must be inspected
- strategy code must be executed on historical data
- trade logs must be generated
- metrics must be computed
- Excel output must be produced
- charts must be generated
- validations must be run

---

# Agent Operating Rules

The agent must:

- inspect the workbook before assuming schema
- use actual columns only
- use actual sheet names only
- use actual available dates only
- record assumptions explicitly
- not silently fill missing rules with guesses
- not stop after partial work if the task can continue
- keep outputs auditable and reproducible
- align generated strategy code with the local coding pattern when such a pattern exists

The agent must not:

- invent columns
- invent sheets
- invent timeframes
- invent fills, trades, or metrics
- report results without validation
- generate code in a style that is inconsistent with the existing local strategy framework unless explicitly requested

---

# Expected Local Environment

Typical local environment may include:

- one Excel workbook containing OHLC data
- existing Python strategy files
- output folders for CSV, Excel, and charts

The exact schema must be discovered from the workbook before implementation.

---

# Standard Execution Flow

## Case 1: User gives only an idea
Flow:
1. Use `STRATEGY_TEMPLATE.md`
2. convert idea to structured rules
3. identify assumptions
4. use `STRATEGY_CODE_TEMPLATE.md`
5. generate strategy code
6. use `BACKTEST_ENGINE.md`

## Case 2: User gives detailed rules
Flow:
1. verify rule completeness
2. if needed, lightly normalize with `STRATEGY_TEMPLATE.md`
3. use `STRATEGY_CODE_TEMPLATE.md`
4. then use `BACKTEST_ENGINE.md`

## Case 3: User gives existing code and wants fixes
Flow:
1. inspect current strategy logic
2. normalize intended rules using `STRATEGY_TEMPLATE.md` if needed
3. align or repair implementation through `STRATEGY_CODE_TEMPLATE.md`
4. rerun through `BACKTEST_ENGINE.md`
5. validate outputs

## Case 4: User asks for optimization
Flow:
1. structure baseline strategy using `STRATEGY_TEMPLATE.md`
2. define tunable parameters
3. generate or normalize implementation using `STRATEGY_CODE_TEMPLATE.md`
4. run controlled backtests via `BACKTEST_ENGINE.md`
5. compare variants without overstating robustness

---

# Completion Standard

The task is not complete until all applicable items are done:

- strategy structure is defined
- assumptions are listed
- workbook is inspected
- code is implemented or updated
- backtest is run
- trade log is generated
- metrics are computed
- Excel workbook is generated if requested
- charts are generated or exported if requested
- validations are run
- result summary is returned

If any part is blocked, clearly state what is blocked and why.

---

# Final Response Standard

Return these sections:

1. Strategy Structure
2. Assumptions
3. Data Notes
4. Code Notes
5. Implementation Notes
6. Backtest Results
7. Validation Notes
8. Output Files
9. Next Improvements

Keep the response concise but complete.

---

# Important Metrics To Report

Always report these when available:

- Total Trades
- Win Rate
- Average Win
- Average Loss
- Profit Factor
- Max Drawdown
- CAR
- CAR/MDD

Add others only if supported by the implementation.

---

# Important Principle

This skill system exists to make OHLC strategy work reproducible.

The agent should behave like a disciplined quant research assistant:
- first structure the strategy,
- then map it into the local coding style,
- then inspect the workbook,
- then implement and run,
- then validate,
- then report.
